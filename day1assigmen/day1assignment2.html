    <p>the scope of a variable defined with the keyword "var" is limited to the "function" within which is defined.
    If it is difined outsideany function ,the scope of the variable is global.
         var is "function scoped".</p>
    <script>
        var a; //global variable
        a=1;
        console.log("Value of a is ",a);

        var sites={
            s1:"cwipedia.in",
            s2:"unknonw"
            //these are objects
        }
        console.log(sites);
        console.table(sites);
    </script>
    <font size="6" color="blue">let</font>
    <p>
        let: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
“let” and “const” are“block scoped”.
    </p>
    <script>
        {
            let name="Shubh";// loacl scope 
            console.log("Name: ",name); 
        }
    </script>
    <font size="4" color="red">Why would you chose “let” over “var”?</font>
    <p>
While programming in Javascript it is a good practice not to define variables as global variables.
 This is because it is possible to inadvertently modify the global variable from anywhere within the Javascript code.
 To prevent this one needs to ensure that the scope of the variables are limited to the code block within which they need to be executed.
    </p>
    <font size="6" color="blue">const</font>
    <p>
        const: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.
“const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.</p>
<script>
{
    const a = [1,2,3];
    const b = {name: "hello"};
    a.push(4,5);     //mutating the value of constant "a"
    b.name="World";  //mutating the value of constant "b"
    
    console.log(a); //this will show [1,2,3,4,5]
    console.log(b); //this will show {name: "World"}
    
   }
   /* This code will run without any errors, and shows that we CAN mutate the values that are defined by "const" */
        const s="Constant";
        console.log(s);
        s="Not const";
        console.log("it may throw error",s);
        /In addition the variable cannot be reassigned to a different value./

    var is functional scope.
    let, const are both BLOCK scope.
    const, cannot be reassigned, however it is mutable.
